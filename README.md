# Android Template Generator

Generate ready-made templates for Android projects — **inspired by [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/)**.

This project consists of two parts:
- **Backend** – built with Kotlin and Spring Boot
- **Frontend** – built with Next.js

## 📖 Description

The **Android Template Generator** is a productivity tool designed to simplify the setup process for new Android projects.

Configuring frameworks, dependencies, and project structures from scratch can be repetitive and time-consuming — especially when starting fresh.

This tool automates that process, enabling developers to instantly generate ready-to-use templates.  
Focus on building great features, not boilerplate setup.
